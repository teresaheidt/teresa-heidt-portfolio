                        I am a web designer and developer.
                        Being creative and designing captivating content is my focus.
                        I am always thinking outside the box and bringing new ideas to the table.
                        This is why I want to help YOU create, design and implement your projects.
                        I have passion, drive and I am self-motivated. My solid work ethic enables me to give my all on any project I work on. 
                        In 2020, I graduated with a certificate from Southern Methodist University in Full Stack Web Developement. 
                        In 2016, I was the recipient of the NMG Best award for oustanding service at the Neiman Marcus Group.
                        Born and raised in England, I have lived in the U.S. for the past twenty years.
                        I love helping people, solving problems and performing my very best.
                        One of my passions is writing and in 2018, I published a book called
                        'Personal Appearances Are Everything'. In November 2020, my second book was published, 'Online Or Off'. 
                        One more book is due for release in 2021. 
                        In my spare time I love; running, reading, writing, coding and spending time with my Shar-pei pug üê∂.
